# My Datasets Repository

Welcome to my **central repository for datasets**, curated for data analysis, machine learning, AI, and visualization projects.  
This repository contains datasets I’ve collected, processed, and structured for educational, research, and analytical purposes.

## Repository Structure

Each dataset is stored in its **own folder** with its own `README.md`, data files (CSV, JSON, etc.), and optional plots or notebooks.

```
